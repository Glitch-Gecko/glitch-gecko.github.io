I'm a cyber security major with a passion for learning and improving my abilities in programming. I'm currently a sophomore, and am skilled and have experience in many languages, including Python, Autohotkey, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C++, Lua, PHP, Bash, Ruby, VBScript, and Powershell.


Note: This website hasn't been updated in some time, I've been off working on some other projects for security and for school, but I have still been quite active with cybersecurity and the CTF scene!
