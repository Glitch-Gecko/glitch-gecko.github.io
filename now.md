# Education
Currently I'm a sophomore in college going for a degree in cybersecurity. Because of my love for mathematics and computing, I'm considering going for a double major in mathematics and cybersecurity, with a minor in comp sci.

I'm largely self-taught when it comes to cybersecurity, despite taking several courses in the field, such as Enterprise Security, Programming for Penetration Testing, and Cybersecurity Policy. Most of my experience comes from tryhackme, various CTFs I've done, and from researching and practicing on my own.

# Work
I've been a lifeguard for the past four years, for two different employers. I currently work for a park district as head guard, working at an outdoor pool over the summer and an indoor lap pool for the rest of the year.

# Hobbies
I have a lot of hobbies that I'm very interested in, and recently I've been spending a lot of time slacklining. I love being in water, and was a varsity swimmer, diver, and water polo player back in high school.

# Music
Music is a big part of my life, and I was a bass clarinetist for eight years. I don't own a bass clarinet, so recently I've been learning piano, and I also occasionally play flute or guitar.

# Art
While studying abroad in Rome, I decided to make use of my Samsung Note 20 and I started working on digital art. My skills since then have developed and improved, and I now spend some of my free time drawing, sketching, or painting, both physically and digitally. You can view some of my art on my twitter or my other website (neither of which have been created yet).

# XR
One of my biggest passions is XR, as I see it as the future of the world. I try to stay very up to date on upcoming VR and AR tech, and spend much of my money on new or experimental hardware. My next project will be building prototype 4 of the [LucidGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves), for a more realistic experience in VR.

# Investing
When I have downtime, I try to spend it researching and learning about investment strategies in the hopes that I'll be able to build up a solid retirement account for myself. I've been watching a lot of [CottonCandyTA](https://youtube.com/c/c0tt0nc4ndyTA) recently for technical analysis, for both stocks and cryptocurrency.
