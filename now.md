# Education
Currently I'm a junior in college going for a degree in cybersecurity.

I'm largely self-taught when it comes to cybersecurity, despite taking several courses for cybersecurity, but I try to push myself to strengthen and broaden my skillset.

# Cybersecurity Experience
Most of my relevant cybersecurity experience comes from participating in competitions. For the past three years, I've been part of a team that has consistently placed high in several collegiate cyber defense competitions, and has also done well in various CTFs.

This past summer, I also took a cybersecurity analyst internship at Panduit, where I learned a lot about what it's like to be in a corporate cybersecurty job role. I'm very thankful for the internship opportunity, and I feel that it scratched the experience itch that school just didn't.

# Hobbies
I have a lot of hobbies that I'm very interested in, and recently I've been spending my free time slacklining, rock climbing, and working out at the gym.

I've been working hard and preparing for a 20 hour drive to Moab, Utah, where I'm hopefully going to walk across a 1" wide 88' long highline. (Just gotta get that sit start down)

Other than my physical hobbies, I've also been improving my skills for CTFs, and I've been fleshing out my [Arch Ignition Key](https://github.com/Glitch-Gecko/arch-ignition-key), which is a script to setup Arch Linux with my custom dotfiles.
