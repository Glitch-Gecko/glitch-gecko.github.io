If done correctly, taking notes provides a deeper understanding in material while simultaneously giving a custom source that you can refer to whenever needed.

I have to admit, I was never much a note-taker for most of my life. It seemed like an unnecessary chore to me, especially when I could just use Quizlet to cram for a test. After I started college, though, I realized just how important proper note-taking could be.

# Obsidian

I think the main reason notes didn't work for me in the past was that I simply wasn't taking effective notes. I had no formatting, nothing to make my notes easy to access, and none of it was organized.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is an extremely powerful tool designed to allow for fully customizable markdown note-taking with a large list of additional features, including:
- A graph view of your notes.
- Backlinks from one note to another.
- Markdown formatting.
- Plugin support.

## How Obsidian Works

Obsidian stores notes locally in a folder referred to as a 'vault'. This vault contains all plugins, notes, images, or anything else used in your notes.
