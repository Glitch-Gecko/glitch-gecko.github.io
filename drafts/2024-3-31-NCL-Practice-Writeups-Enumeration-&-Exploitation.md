NCL practice round Enumeration & Exploitation challenge writeups

---

Following a short break after this year's CCDC, I jumped back into the CTF grind and started studying Crypto and Binary Exploitation. I've been looking for an opportunity to utilize my new skills, and it just so happens that my Cyber Defense Club was looking to sign a team up for the National Cyber League.

It definitely seems like I've learned a lot, especially since at the time of writing this, I'm 8th place out of almost 8,000 participants in the practice round, with over 95% challenge completion.

To help others (mostly my team at Lewis University), I've decided to create writeups for each challenge.

The following is a list of each Enumeration & Exploitation challenge:

## Gems (Easy)
#### Description: "We have found this gem of a program that contains a flag, help us answer a few questions about its behavior."

```
flag = [ 210, 202, 216, 172, 198, 196, 204, 210, 172, 180, 185, 182, 183 ]

def check_flag?(a, flag)
  return false if a.length < flag.length
  begin
    (a.chars.map.with_index { |c, i| c.unpack("U*")[0] ^ 129 == flag[i] }).all? { |c| c }
  rescue
    false
  end
end

puts "What's your guess for the flag?"
ans = check_flag?(gets.strip, flag)
(puts "You got the flag!"; exit) if ans
puts "Not quite..."
```

# Final thoughts

Even though this was just the practice round, I had a lot of fun working my way through the challenges! I'm very happy with my noticable skill improvement, and I'm definitely excited to see how the individual and team rounds go.

Make sure to check out my other writeups!
